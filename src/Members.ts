 * Avatar stacks are the most common way of showing the online status of members in an application by displaying an avatar for each member. Events are emitted whenever a member enters or leaves a space, or updates their profile data. Additional information can also be provided, such as a profile picture and email address.
 *
 * Subscribe to the space’s { @link Space.members | `members` } property in order to keep your avatar stack updated in realtime.
 *
 * ## Event types
 *
 * The following four event types are emitted by members:
 *
 * > **Moved documentation**
 * >
 * > This documentation has been moved to { @link MembersEventMap }.
 *
 * > **Note**
 * >
 * > Members {@link Space.enter | enter }, {@link Space.leave | leave }, and {@link Space.updateProfileData | update } a {@link Space | space } directly. The space’s { @link Space.members | `members` } property is used to subscribe to these updates.

 * ## Avatar stack foundations
 *
 * The Spaces SDK is built upon existing Ably functionality available in Ably’s Core SDKs. Understanding which core features are used to provide the abstractions in the Spaces SDK enables you to manage space state and build additional functionality into your application.
 *
 * Avatar stacks build upon the functionality of the Pub/Sub Channels [presence](https://ably.com/docs/presence-occupancy/presence) feature. Members are entered into the presence set when they { @link Space.enter | enter the space }.

   * Subscribe to members’ online status and profile updates by registering a listener. Member events are emitted whenever a member {@link Space.enter | enters} or {@link Space.leave | leaves} the space, or updates their profile data. Use the `subscribe()` method on the `members` object of a space to receive updates.
   *
   * The following is an example of subscribing to the different member event types:
   *
   * ```javascript
   * // Subscribe to member enters in a space
   * space.members.subscribe('enter', (memberUpdate) => {
   *   console.log(memberUpdate);
   * });
   *
   * // Subscribe to member profile data updates in a space
   * space.members.subscribe('update', (memberUpdate) => {
   *   console.log(memberUpdate);
   * });
   *
   * // Subscribe to member leaves in a space
   * space.members.subscribe('leave', (memberUpdate) => {
   *   console.log(memberUpdate);
   * });
   *
   * // Subscribe to member removals in a space
   * space.members.subscribe('remove', (memberUpdate) => {
   *   console.log(memberUpdate);
   * });
   * ```
   * It’s also possible to subscribe to multiple event types with the same listener by using an array:
   *
   * ```javascript
   * space.members.subscribe(['enter', 'update'], (memberUpdate) => {
   *   console.log(memberUpdate);
   * });
   * ```
   * Or subscribe to all event types:
   *
   * ```javascript
   * space.members.subscribe((memberUpdate) => {
   *   console.log(memberUpdate);
   * });
   * ```
   * The following is an example payload of a member event. The `lastEvent.name` describes which {@link SpaceEventMap | event type } a payload relates to.
   *
   * ```json
   *   {
   *     "clientId": "clemons#142",

   *
   *   ```ts
   *   space.members.subscribe('remove', (member: SpaceMember) => {})
   *   ```
   *
   *   The argument supplied to the callback is a {@link SpaceMember} object representing the member removed from the space.
   *
   * - ##### **updateProfile**
   *
   *   Listen to profile update events of members.
   *
   *   ```ts
   *   space.members.subscribe('updateProfile', (member: SpaceMember) => {})
