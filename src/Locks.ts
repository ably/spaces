 * The component locking feature enables members to optimistically lock stateful UI components before editing them. This reduces the chances of conflicting changes being made to the same component by different members. A component could be a cell in a spreadsheet that a member is updating, or an input field on a form they’re filling in.
 *
 * Once a lock has been acquired by a member, the component that it relates to can be updated in the UI to visually indicate to other members that it is locked and and which member has the lock. The component can then be updated once the editing member has released the lock to indicate that it is now unlocked.
 *
 * Each lock is identified by a unique string ID, and only a single member may hold a lock with a given string at any one time. A lock will exist in one of three { @link LockStatus | states } and may only transition between states in specific circumstances.
 *
 * > **Important**
 * >
 * > Optimistic locking means that there is a chance that two members may begin editing the same UI component before it is confirmed which member holds the lock. On average, the time taken to reconcile which member holds a lock is in the hundreds of milliseconds. Your application needs to handle the member that successfully obtained the lock, as well as the member that had their request invalidated.
 *
 * ## Lock states
 *
 * Component locking is handled entirely client-side. Members may begin to optimistically edit a component as soon as they call {@link acquire | `acquire()` } on the lock identifier related to it. Alternatively, you could wait until they receive a `locked` event and display a spinning symbol in the UI until this is received. In either case a subsequent `unlocked` event may invalidate that member’s lock request if another member acquired it earlier. The time for confirmation of whether a lock request was successful or rejected is, on average, in the hundreds of milliseconds, however your code should handle all possible lock state transitions.
 *
 * A lock will be in one of the following states:
 *
 * > **Moved documentation**
 * >
 * > This documentation has been moved to { @link LockStatuses }.
 *
 * The following lock state transitions may occur:
 *
 * - None → `pending`: a member calls {@link acquire | `acquire()` } to request a lock.
 * - `pending` → `locked`: the requesting member holds the lock.
 * - `pending` → `unlocked`: the requesting member does not hold the lock, since another member already holds it.
 * - `locked` → `unlocked`: the lock was either explicitly {@link release | released} by the member, or their request was invalidated by a concurrent request which took precedence.
 * - `unlocked` → `locked`: the requesting member reacquired a lock they previously held.
 *
 * Only transitions that result in a `locked` or `unlocked` status will emit a lock event that members can {@link subscribe | `subscribe()` } to.

   * Use the `acquire()` method to attempt to acquire a lock with a given unique ID. Additional `attributes` may be passed when trying to acquire a lock that can contain a set of arbitrary key-value pairs. An example of using `attributes` is to store the component ID the lock relates to so that it can be easily updated in the UI with a visual indication of its lock status.
   *
   * A member must have been {@link Space.enter | entered } into the space to acquire a lock.
   *
   * The following is an example of attempting to acquire a lock:
   *
   * ```javascript
   * const acquireLock = await space.locks.acquire(id);
   * ```
   * The following is an example of passing a set of `attributes` when trying to acquire a lock:
   *
   * ```javascript
   * const lockAttributes = new Map();
   * lockAttributes.set('component', 'cell-d3');
   * const acquireLock = await space.locks.acquire(id, { lockAttributes });
   * ```
   * The following is an example payload returned by `space.locks.acquire()`. The promise will resolve to a lock request with the `pending` status:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "id": "s2-d14",
   *   "status": "pending",
   *   "timestamp": 1247525689781,
   *   "attributes": {
   *     "componentId": "cell-d14"
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * Once a member requests a lock by calling `acquire()`, the lock is temporarily in the {@link LockStatuses.Pending | pending state }. An event will be emitted based on whether the lock request was successful (a status of `locked`) or invalidated (a status of `unlocked`). This can be {@link subscribe | subscribed } to in order for the client to know whether their lock request was successful or not.
   *
   * <!-- END WEBSITE DOCUMENTATION -->
   *
   * <!-- BEGIN CLASS-DEFINITIONS DOCUMENTATION -->
   * Send a request to acquire a lock. Returns a Promise which resolves once the request has been sent. A resolved Promise holds a `pending` {@link Lock}. An error will be thrown if a lock request with a status of `pending` or `locked` already exists, returning a rejected promise.
   *
   * When a lock acquisition by a member is confirmed with the `locked` status, an `update` event will be emitted. Hence to handle lock acquisition, `acquire()` needs to always be used together with `subscribe()`.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * ```ts
   * const id = "/slide/1/element/3";
   * const lockRequest = await space.locks.acquire(id);
   * ```
   * <!-- END CLASS-DEFINITIONS DOCUMENTATION -->

   * @param id A unique identifier which specifies the lock to acquire.
   * @param opts An object whose {@link LockOptions.attributes | `attributes`} property specifies additional metadata to associate with the lock.

    }

    // check there isn't an existing PENDING or LOCKED request for the current

    let lock = this.getLock(id, self.connectionId);
    if (lock && lock.status !== 'unlocked') {

For example, the `release()` method can be called once a user clicks outside of the component, such as clicking on another cell within a spreadsheet. Any UI indications that the previous cell was locked can then be cleared.
   *
   * The following is an example of releasing a lock:
   *
   * ```javascript
